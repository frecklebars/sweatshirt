## “To my son Thebe, whose growth and insights inspire me, a thousand kisses”
tl;dr its a markov chain that makes songs  
yeah its been done before but hey, I like rap and I'm learning these craps so might as well do it again

## How to use it
open cmd in the folder sweatshirt is downloaded in  
### to learn
type `learn.py <dictionary path> <train set path>` and hit enter. if there's no dictionary already made, it'll make a new file  
for example i go `learn.py dictionary.json scraper/lyrics.txt`  
### to generate
pretty much the same  
type `generate.py <dictionary path>` and be amazed
  
## to do(?):
* maybe make it look nicer?
* ~~read on lyric structure and theory~~
* ~~actually build a song database (will use a genius ripper i found)~~
* ~~make picking random words not really random but based on frequency~~
* ~~make the dictionary store two words instead of one for better results~~
* ~~handle formatting better~~ eh still could do better
* ~~think of how bars lenght should be done~~
* ???
* sleep
