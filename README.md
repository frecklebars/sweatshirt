## “To my son Thebe Whose growth and insights inspire me, a thousand kisses”
tl;dr its a markov chain that makes songs  
yeah its been done before but hey, I like rap and I'm learning these craps so might as well do it again

### still work in progress
### to do:
* actually build a song database (will use a genius ripper i found)
* make picking random words not really random but based on frequency
* ~~make the dictionary store two words instead of one for better results~~
* ~~handle special characters better~~ eh still could do better
* think of how bars lenght should be done
* ???
* sleep
